# Hifi.rs

A terminal-based (tui), high resolution audio player for the discerning listener. Backed by [Qobuz](https://www.qobuz.com). Requires a paid subscription.

As a linux user with a subscription to Qobuz, I was frustrated that there isn't more support for the OS. You can use Squeezelite or Roon to stream music, but both require separate interfaces which make it less than ideal to search and play music quickly while working.

## Features

- High resolution audio: Supports up to 24bit/192Khz
- MPRIS support (control via playerctl or other client)
- Can resume a previous session, including track position
- TUI can be disabled to use as a headless player
- Searches output JSON for piping to `jq`
